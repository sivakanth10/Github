Fork:

in the GitHub context, doesn't extend Git.
It only allows clone on the server side.

When you are cloning a GitHub repo on your local workstation, you cannot contribute back to the upstream repo unless you are explicitly declared as "contributor".
So that clone (to your local workstation) isn't a "fork". It is just a clone.

The other solution to contribute to that GitHub project is to:

clone that GitHub repo on your GitHub account (that is the "fork" part, a clone on the server side)
contribute commits to that GitHub repo (it is in your own GitHub account, so you have every right to push to it)
signal any interesting contribution back to the original GitHub repo (that is the "pull request" part)
Check also "Collaborative GitHub Workflow".

If you want to keep a link with the original repo (also called upstream), you need to add a remote referring that original repo.
See "What is the difference between origin and upstream in github"
